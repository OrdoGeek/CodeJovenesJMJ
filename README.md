This project creates random groups of youngh people from my church.  

# PROBLEM
In the church I assist, there are arround 50 youngh people working together and making many different activities, in order to gather founds and being able to go to meet the Pope Francisco in August 2023, at Lisboa-Portugal.

There is a group of 12 leaders, which is in charge of managing the activities and assigning functions to the rest of youngh. I am part of that group. We had to organize poeple in different groups, because there were a lot. These groups were modified each month, so we had to do the same proccess every single month. Doing that we spent almost 1.5 hours. Considering this, and looking for a way to optimize our time, I created this program, which creates random groups taking into account aspects like:

- ¿Are there siblings and are in the same community? If so, they must be in the same group.
- ¿Are there poeple who work more than others? Then, the groups must be conformed in a balanced way, this is, with people who work a lot, and with people who do not work as much as others.
